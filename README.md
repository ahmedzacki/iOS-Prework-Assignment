# Prework - _IOS101: Intro to iOS Development_

Submitted by: **Ahmed Handulle**

**Change Color App** By creating this simple iOS app, I explored the foundations of iOS development. I started with setting up Xcode and familiarized myself with its IDE, I progressed to building a basic app using Swift and tested the UI using simulators. The app allows you to change the background color of an iphone 14 pro. 

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented features:

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

# WhatsApp:

- [ ] Media Sharing: The ease of sharing various media types, including photos, videos, and documents, enhances communication.

# Spotify:

- [ ] Personalized Playlists: Spotify's curated playlists and personalized recommendations based on listening habits contribute to a tailored music experience.

# Google Maps:

- [ ] Local Business Information: Integration with local business information, reviews, and photos adds value beyond navigation.

## App Idea:

- [ ] I envision an app called "HealthTrackr," for simplifying and enhancing personal health management. The app would integrate features from various health-related apps into a unified platform. Users can track their fitness activities, nutrition intake, and mental well-being in one place. The app would offer personalized health insights and recommendations based on user data. Additionally, it could include a social aspect, allowing users to connect with friends for shared fitness goals and challenges. The goal is to create a comprehensive health hub that streamlines health monitoring and encourages a holistic approach to well-being. Features would include activity tracking, meal logging, mental health check-ins, and a social community for support and motivation.

## Notes

This project was straightforward, and I didn't encounter any major challenges. However, I need to expand my knowledge of the Swift syntax a little bit more.
